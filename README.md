canvas-text-metrics-polyfill
============================

A polyfill for the enhanced context.measureText in HTML Canvas v5 / Canvas 2D Context Level 2. Based on https://github.com/Pomax/fontmetrics.js .

The upcoming version of Canvas will offer a standard way to get 2D font metrics where only a single measurement (width) has been available previously. The feature introduced to the spec in March 2012, but as of November 2014, browser support for the extra properties is lacking.

This library provides a robust polyfill based on already-available Canvas and DOM techniques.
